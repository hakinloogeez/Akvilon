This is not Akvilon, this wallet will be used to test a fork of ZiftrCoin. This will not be ZiftrCoin either, this will be a completely new coin using a snapshot of the ZiftrCoin blockchain and the addresses. Also, this is not a release, this is a test at the moment.

# Ziftr Fork Test
Name : ZiftrV2

Symbol : ZFT2

Algorithm : Skein（POW/POS/MN）

Total amount : Infinite

Premine : TBD at time of release (Not Including Original Coins Pre-Fork)

Last POW Block : Block 3,000,000

Block time : 60S

Block size : 40MB

Coin base maturity :  50 blocks

Diffculty Re-Target : 5 blocks

Stake Minimum Age: 16 Hours

The official planned pool currently is : https://miningpoolfun.club 0.5% fee

Masternode Requires : 100,000 This is due to the large amount of coins that will be in circulation before the fork. It is possible that 169+ masternodes could be brought online at the time of release. Masternode collateral could be changed at a later date should the dev, team, and community decide on it via vote. This can not and will not happen before a proper trusted team ( 6 or more members) is in place, we have a large community, and we have reached at least block 1,750,000.   

RPCPORT = 10339

PORT = 10338

Fork at Block 1,650,001

Premine Over at Block 1,653,107 (Total Premine including stakes TBD at release)

Testing Phase Over at Block 1,654,500 (Coins mined or staked during this period will be added to premine if the wallet isn't released before the end of this phase)

Premine, addresses to be added later to show transparency, are to be used as follows:

All funds will be kept in a single, encrypted, and staking wallet until they are spent or distributed to contest winners, developers, moderators, etc. No funds from the staking wallet will be used for anything other than the items listed below. Developer and or team will be paid from stakes for continued devlopment and consulting. These payouts will be deteremed at a later date by the development team and community.

1,000,000 ZFT2 to be given away in contests, rules, terms, etc. TBD.

1,000,000 ZFT2 to be used for Block Explorer building and hosting purposes.

10,000,000 ZFT2 to be kept by hakinloogeez for use at his discretion. These coins will be released upon successful compiling, start up, and premine of the coin. These coins, the 10m only and doesn't include any possible stakes or masternode payments, are not allowed to be introduced to any exchange prior to block 1,661,000. Prior to block 1,661,000 coins may be used by hakinloogeez for masternodes, staking, trading between individuals (no more than 100,000 may be used for trading between individuals prior to block 1,661,000), etc. This is payment for development of wallet.

5,000,000 ZFT2 to be kept for staking by coin/dev team in seperate wallet/ node to help keep chain alive. All stakes will be part of the developmental fund. 

500,010 ZFT2 to be kept for masternodes, a total of 5 masternodes the extra 10 coins are for fees and will be used at 2 ZFT2 per transaction, by coin/dev team to help keep chain alive for a minimum of a year from start of each masternode or as long as community is actively supporting the coin. Should the community decide to abandon this project, the masternodes will be taken offline and the 500,000 original coins will be retuned to the developmental fund addresses. All masternode payments while online will be added to development funding and added to the same wallet that contains the devolpmental funds. 

150,000 ZFT2 will be given to the official pool operator for hosting the official pool.

The rest of the Premine, if there is any, will be used for building a trusted devlopment team, website development, giveaways, moderation of discord, promotion, development, etc. over time. These funds will be kept in the developmental funds addresses.

No premined funds that are in control of the coin/ dev team will be used for getting added to exchanges (this does not include funds used to pay the dev for the wallet, as giveaways, other payments for various contests, or work done as we have no control over what happens to the funds after they leave our wallets). The desire to have the coin on an exchange is understandable but, since the coin is new, we should work our way on to an exchange over time, not buy our way on to it and become just another "Pump 'N' Dump". This does more damage than good for the coin and the community. We can't stop exchanges from adding us or any member of the community from buying a spot on an exchange but I can keep all of the premined coins in our possesion from being used for that. Also, no plans have been made to sell masternodes. We may change our minds at some point should we need a different cryptocurrency to fund our development as ZFTV2 isnt a mainstream coin like BTC, BCH, or LTC. ZFTV2 is designed to be a long term coin with an infinite block chain and rewards. The purpose here is to have a coin with multiple features that can be useful to different people in different situations for the lifetime of cryptocurrency. As this is just the first release of the wallet there may be bugs, I will attempt to fix any and all of them through the premine and testing phase this is why the premine and testing phase spans for as many blocks as it does. If no issues arrise duriung the premine or the testing phase after block 1,653,107, we will be cutting the testing phase short and releasing the wallet earlier.
