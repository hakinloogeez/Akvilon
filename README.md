This is not Akvilon, this wallet will be used to test a fork of ZiftrCoin. This will not be ZiftrCoin either, this will be a completely new coin using a snapshot of the ZiftrCoin blockchain and the addresses. Also, this is not a release, this is a test at the moment.

# Ziftr Fork Test
Name : ZiftrV2

Symbol : ZFT2

Algorithm : Skein（POW/POS/MN）

Total amount : Infinite

Premine : TBD at time of release (Not Including Original Coins Pre-Fork) 

Last POW Block : Block 3,000,000

Block time : 60S

Block size : 40MB

Coin base maturity :  50 blocks

Diffculty Re-Target : 5 blocks

Stake Minimum Age: 16 Hours

Masternode Requires : 1,000,000

RPCPORT = 10339

PORT = 10338

Fork at Block 1,650,001

Premine Over at Block 1,700,000 (Total Premine TBD at release ZFT2)

Premine to be used as follows:

1,000,000 ZFT2 to be given away in a contest as a single masternode

1,000,000 ZFT2 to be used for Block Explorer Build and Hosting

10,000,000 ZFT2 to be kept by dev for use at his discretion

5,000,000 ZFT2 to be kept for staking by coin/dev in seperate wallet/ node to keep chain alive

5,000,000 ZFT2 to be kept for masternodes by coin/dev to keep chain alive

The rest of the Premine will be used for giveaways, development, etc. over time

No premined funds will be used for exchanges. The desire to have the coin on an exchange is understandable but, since the coin is new, we should work our way on to an exchange over time, not buy our way on to it and become just another "Pump 'N' Dump". This does more damage than good for the coin and the community. We can't stop exchanges from adding us or any member of the community from buying a spot on an exchange but I can keep all of the premined coins in our possesion from being used for that. ZFTV2 is designed to be a long term coin with an infinite block chain and rewards. The purpose here is to have a coin with multiple features that can be useful to different people in different situations for the lifetime of cryptocurrency. As this is just the first release of the wallet there may be bugs, I will attempt to fix any and all of them through the premine and testing phase this is why the premine and testing phase spans 49,999 blocks or 2,083 days.
